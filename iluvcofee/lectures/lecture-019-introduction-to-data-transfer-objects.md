- DTO (Data Transfer Object)
  - Object used to encapsulate data and send it from one application to another;
  - Help us define the interfaces for the input and output within our system;
  - Ex.: with DTOs we can define the shape or interface of what we are expecting to receive for the body in a POST request;
  - (terminal) Add DTO to specify the shape of the body for creating a new coffee: `nest g class coffees/dto/create-coffee.dto --no-spec --flat`;
  - (terminal) Use the cli help to check options for CLI commands: `nest g class --help`;
