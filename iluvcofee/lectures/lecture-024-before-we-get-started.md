This chapter is a continuation of Chapter 2 - “Creating a REST API Application” - which is a part of the “Standard path” of this Course - but there is also a Bonus “NoSQL / MongoDB” chapter that begins right where Chapter 2 left off as well.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: If you want to code along through both these database chapters - make sure you SAVE YOUR PROGRESS from this last chapter into a separate branch. This way you can use it later for the MongoDB bonus chapter.
If you’re using git, make sure to create a new branch to store your current progress, and then head back to your master branch to continue along with this PostgreSQL & TypeORM Chapter as well as the rest of the course.

By fracturing these SQL & NoSQL sections, you can easily choose and watch whichever section you need for your project (or code along through both).
